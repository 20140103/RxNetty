##### Change in behavior

As part of  [Issue 206] (https://github.com/Netflix/RxNetty/issues/206) the following change in behavior is done in this release:

##### Old Behavior
- Before this fix, the the `Observable` returned from `HttpClient.submit()` used to complete after the content of the response completed.
- The content could be lost (this issue) if the content was subscribed out of the `onNext` call of `HttpClientResponse`

##### New Behavior
- After this fix, the `Observable` returned from `HttpClient.submit()` completes immediately after one callback of `HttpClientResponse`. 
- The content can be subscribed out of the `onNext` call of `HttpClientResponse` till the content timeout as described in #206.
