Reactive Extension (Rx) Adaptor for Netty

Getting Started
==========

The best place to start exploring this library is to look at the [examples] (rxnetty-examples) for some common usecases addressed by RxNetty.

A very simple HTTP server example can be found [here] (rxnetty-examples/src/main/java/io/reactivex/netty/examples/http/helloworld/HelloWorldServer.java)
and the corresponding HTTP client is [here] (rxnetty-examples/src/main/java/io/reactivex/netty/examples/http/helloworld/HelloWorldClient.java)

## Binaries

The binaries for 0.5.x are only available as snapshots at [jfrog artifactory](https://oss.jfrog.org/webapp/search/artifact/?1&q=RxNetty), the following snippet can be used to refer to these artifacts with gradle:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://oss.jfrog.org/libs-snapshot' }
}
```
##### For HTTP
```groovy
compile 'io.reactivex:rxnetty-http:0.5.2-SNAPSHOT'
```
###### Unintentional release artifacts

There are two artifacts in maven central 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 which were unintentionally released from 0.4.x branch. Do not use them. [More details here](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxNetty/issues/439)
