Getting Started
==========

The best place to start exploring this library is to look at the class [RxNetty] (https://github.com/Netflix/RxNetty/blob/master/rx-netty/src/main/java/io/reactivex/netty/RxNetty.java)

You can also find some common examples of clients and servers created using RxNetty in the [examples directory] (https://github.com/Netflix/RxNetty/tree/master/rx-netty/src/examples)

A very simple HTTP server example can be found [here] (https://github.com/Netflix/RxNetty/blob/master/rx-netty/src/examples/java/io/reactivex/netty/examples/java/HttpWelcomeServer.java)
and the corresponding HTTP client is [here] (https://github.com/Netflix/RxNetty/blob/master/rx-netty/src/examples/java/io/reactivex/netty/examples/java/HelloHttpClient.java)
